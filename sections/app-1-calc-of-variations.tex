Calculus of variations functional $J$\footnote{A functional is is a generalization of a function that depends on infinitely many parameters. In this case, $J$ depends on the value of $y$ at \textit{every} point between $x_1$ and $x_2$, so we could also write $J\big(\{y_i\}\big)$ where $\{y_i\}=\{y(x_i):x_i\in[x_1, x_2]\}$. Note that this set $\{y_i\}$ contains an uncountably infinite number of elements, hence the "functional" $J$ has infinite degrees of freedom.}


\eqn{J = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}f\big\{y(x), y'(x); x\big\}dx}

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		y(x) & \rightarrow y(\alpha, x) = y(x) + \alpha\eta(x) \\
		J & \rightarrow J(\alpha) = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}f\big\{y(\alpha, x), y'(\alpha, x); x\big\}dx \\
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

\eqn{\pd{J}{\alpha}\bigg\rvert_{\alpha=0}=0}

% Euler's Equation Derivation
Euler's equation can be derived from the above

\eqn{\pd{J}{\alpha} = \pd{}{\alpha}\int_{x_1}^{x_2}f\big\{y(x), y'(x); x\big\}dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}\left(\pd{f}{y}\pd{y}{\alpha} + \pd{f}{y'}\pd{y'}{\alpha}\right)dx}

\eqn{\pd{J}{\alpha} = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}\left(\pd{f}{y}\eta(x) + \pd{f}{y'}\frac{d\eta}{dx}\right)dx\where \pd{y}{\alpha} = \eta(x),\quad \pd{y'}{\alpha}=\frac{d\eta}{dx}}
