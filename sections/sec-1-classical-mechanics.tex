\section{Classical Mechanics}
The classical mechanics subject matter in the qualifying exam is primarily at the level of \cite{thorntonClassicalDynamicsParticles2004}, a common, upper-level undergraduate mechanics text.

\subsection{Newtonian Mechanics}
Newtonian mechanics is typically covered in the introductory-level mechanics courses, but is worth mentioning for completeness.
