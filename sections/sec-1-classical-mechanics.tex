\section{Newtonian Mechanics}
\label{sec:cm-newtonian}
Newtonian mechanics is typically covered in the introductory-level mechanics courses, but the basics are worth revisiting for completeness. \index{Newton}

Objects do not change their motion unless acted on by external forces, and when acted upon, the acceleration is linearly proportional to the net applied force. The coefficient is \textbf{inertial mass}, not to be confused with other notions of "mass" as will be seen in Sec \ref{sec:specrel}

\eqn{\sum \vec{F} = \vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}}

The solution for Newtonian equations of motion under constant acceleration, for a general coordinate $q$ is given by: 

\eqn[eq:cm-newt-coord]{q(t) = q_0 + \dot{q}t + \frac{1}{2}\ddot{q}t^2}

In the case of a scalar potential $U$, the force vector $\vec{F}$ is derived as the negative gradient of the potential:
\eqn{\vec{F} = -\del U}

Also worth mentioning, the work-energy theorem relates the force vector $\vec{F}$ along a curve $C$ to the change in potential energy. Be careful to get the signs correct in $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{s}$ before the dot product to get the right signs in the result.
\eqn{W = \int_C\vec{F}(\vec{s})\cdot d\vec{s} = \Delta U} \index{Work-Energy Theorem}

In the absence of external forces, the linear momentum $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$ is conserved, as is the total energy of the system $E = T + U$, where $T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is the Newtonian kinetic energy and $U$ is the potential energy. \index{Conservation of momentum}
\eqn{\ddt[\vec{p}] = \ddt[E] = 0}

%            ANGULAR MOTION             %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Angular Motion}
\label{sec:cm-angular}
\index{Rotation}
Another topic that should be thoroughly engrained in all introductory undergraduate mechanics courses, angular motion will undoubtedly appear on the qualifying exam. We briefly review some key concepts from rotational motion here.

Most of the equations are similar from Sec \ref{sec:cm-newtonian}, with the substitution from translational position coordinates to rotational ones $x \rightarrow \theta$, $v\rightarrow \omega$, etc. Note that Eq \ref{eq:cm-newt-coord} still holds for $q=\theta$. Nearly all the Cartesian-coordinate equations of Newtonian mechanics have a spherical-coordinate analog. For instance $v = \dot{x}$ becomes $\omega = \dot{\theta}$.


The tangential velocity can be related to the angular velocity and radial vector, as can the angular momentum to the linear momentum. Newton's laws about net force and acceleration also have a direct, angular analogue, as does translational kinetic energy:
\eqn{\vec{v}_{\perp} = \vec{\omega}\times \vec{r}}

\eqn{\vec{L} = I \vec{\omega} = \vec{r}\times\vec{p}\where I = \sum_i m_i r_i^2 = \int r^2 dm}

\eqn{\sum\vec{\tau}=\vec{\tau}_{net}=I\ddot{\theta}=\ddt[\vec{L}] \where \vec{\tau} = \vec{r}\times\vec{F}}

\eqn{T_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2}

\index{Angular Momentum}
The moment of inertia is a nuanced mathematical object, given proper treatment in Sec \ref{sec:cm-rigid}. In the simpler cases it is helpful knowing some common moments of inertia:

\eqn{I_{\mathrm{sphere}} = \frac{2}{5}MR^2,\quad I_{\mathrm{shell}} = \frac{2}{3}MR^2}
\eqn{I_{\mathrm{disk}} = \frac{1}{2}MR^2,\quad I_{\mathrm{hoop}} = MR^2}
\eqn{\label{eq:cm-I-rod} I_{\mathrm{rod,end}} = \frac{1}{12}ML^2}

The parallel axis theorem states that if an object has moment of inertia $I_{\hat{a}}$ about an axis $\hat{a}$, and a moment of inertia $I_{\hat{b}}$ about an axis $\hat{b}$, then: 
\eqn{I_{\hat{b}} = I_{\hat{a}} + Md^2\where \hat{b} \parallel \hat{a} \mathrm{\ and\ is\ separated\ by\ distance\ } d}
\index{Parallel-Axis Theorem}

Note that the above can be used to derive $I_{\mathrm{rod,center}} = \frac{1}{3}ML^2$ from Eq \ref{eq:cm-I-rod} with $d = \frac{1}{2}L$.\\

There are also a handful of useful statements about uniform circular motion. The non-slip condition for rolling is when the center of mass and tangential velocities are equal (in magnitude). The acceleration, called centripetal due to its purely-radial nature, can be described in terms of the velocity and radius:\index{Uniform Circular Motion}
\eqn{v_{CM} = v_{\perp}}


\eqn{a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}}


Similar to the Cartesian Newtonian case, in the absence of external torque ($\vec{\tau}_{net}=0$), then the angular momentum is preserved.

%              OSCILLATION              %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Oscillation}
\label{sec:cm-oscillation}
\index{Oscillation}
% Harmonic Motion
\subsection{Harmonic Motion}
Most treatments of oscillation begin with Hooke's Law (Eq \ref{eq:cm-hooke}) instead of the general wave equation because it's easier to work in one-dimension. That approach leads to the second-order homogeneous equation Eq \ref{eq:cm-sho-de}, with the familiar solutions given by Eq \ref{eq:cm-sho-soln} (complex roots of characteristic equation + Euler's Identity $e^{i\theta} = \cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta})$. Plugging into $T = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2$ and $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$ gives Eq \ref{eq:cm-sho-energy}.

\eqn{\label{eq:cm-hooke} F(x) = -kx,\quad U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2}\index{Hooke's Law}
\eqn{\label{eq:cm-sho-de} \ddot{x} +  \omega_0^2x = 0\where \omega_0 = \sqrt\frac{k}{m} = 2\pi \nu_0}

\eqn{\label{eq:cm-sho-soln} x(t) = A\sin{\left(\omega_0 t - \delta\right)}}

\eqn{\label{eq:cm-sho-energy} E = T + U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2}


% Damped Oscillation
\subsection{Damped Oscillation}
When a damping force is added like Eq \ref{eq:cm-damp-force}, the equation of motion has an extra term \index{Oscillation!Damped}
\eqn{\label{eq:cm-damp-force} F_{\mathrm{damp}} = -b\dot{x}}
\eqn{\label{eq:cm-sho-de} \ddot{x} + 2\beta \dot{x} + \omega_0^2x = 0\where \beta = \frac{b}{2m}}
\eqn{\label{eq:cm-dho-soln}
	x(t) = e^{-\beta t}\left[A_1 e^{i\omega t} + A_2e^{-i\omega t}\right]\where \omega^2=\omega_0^2-\beta^2}

Note in the above solution Eq \ref{eq:cm-dho-soln}, the relative values of $\omega_0$ and $\beta$ can produce phenomenologically distinct behavior. Specifically, the cases are:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
		\omega^2 &> 0 & \omega_0^2 &> \beta^2 & \text{Underdamped} \\
		\omega^2 &< 0 & \omega_0^2 &< \beta^2 & \text{Overdamped} \\
		\omega^2 &= 0 & \omega_0^2 &= \beta^2 & \text{Critically Damped} 
\end{align}	
\end{subequations}
Recall the general behavior for the above solution categories: $(i)$ underdamped solutions show an exponentially-decaying oscillation, and will periodically cross the x axis, $(ii)$ overdamped solutions are slowly decaying exponentials without oscillation, and $(iii)$ critically-damped is the unique, most-rapidly decaying exponential without oscillation.\\


% Driven Oscillation
\subsection{Driven Oscillation}
In the case of a driving force (sinusoidal for simplicity), the equation of motion becomes inhomogeneous, and we must solve for the particular solution $x_p(t)$ or "steady-state" effects (as opposed to the complementary solution $x_c(t)$ or "transient" effects of the homogeneous equation given by Eq \ref{eq:cm-dho-soln}). The steady state effects are dominant for $t >> 1/\beta$. \index{Oscillation!Driven}\index{Waves!Transient}\index{Waves!Stead-state}

\eqn{\ddot{x} + 2\beta \dot{x} + \omega_0^2x = A\cos{\omega t}\where A = \frac{F_0}{m}}
\eqn{x_p(t) = D\cos{\left(\omega t - \delta\right)}\where D=\frac{A}{\sqrt{\left(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2\right)^2 + 4\omega^2\beta^2}},\quad \delta=\tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{2\omega\beta}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\right)}}

Resonance effects can be computed by finding the angular frequency $\omega_R$ at which the amplitude $D$ is maximized:
\eqn{\omega_R = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 2\beta^2}\where \frac{dD}{d\omega}\bigg{\rvert}_{\omega=\omega_R}=0}
Note that for weak damping, or where $\beta \rightarrow 0$, then the resonant frequency approaches the natural frequency of the system $\omega_R \rightarrow \omega_0$. \index{Resonance}

%          LAGRANGIAN MECHANICS         %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Lagrangian Mechanics}
\label{sec:cm-lagrangian}

Lagrangian Mechanics marks the separation between introductory and upper-level, undergraduate mechanics material. 
\subsection{Principle of Least Action}
Though most courses introduce the Lagrangian as in Eq \ref{eq:cm-lag-def}, there is a deeper physical principle  motivating the choice of $\Lag$, called Hamilton's Principle:\index{Hamilton's Principle} 
\quotebox[0.8]{Of all the possible paths along which a dynamical system may move from one point to another within a specified time interval (consistent with any constraints), the actual path followed is that which minimizes the time integral of the difference between the kinetic and potential energies.}

The above principle, when combined with a rigorous understanding of calculus of variations (included in Appendix \ref{app:calcvar}), explains why the conventional form of the Lagrangian is $T - U$. To paraphrase Hamilton, \textit{nature seeks the path of least action} by converting the least amount of potential energy into kinetic energy. This is formally represented by Eq. \ref{eq:cm:hamilton-principle}, which ultimately leads to the familiar Lagrangian equations of motion (Eq. \ref{eq:cm:lag-eqn}):

\eqn[eq:cm-lag-def]{\Lag = T - U}
\eqn[eq:cm:hamilton-principle]{\delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\left(T - U\right)dt = 0}
\eqn[eq:cm:lag-eqn]{\pd{\Lag}{q_i} - \ddt \pd{\Lag}{\dot{q}_i} = 0 \where p_i \equiv \pd{\Lag}{\dot{q_i}}}\

% Generalized coordinates
\subsection{Generalized Coordinates}
The above makes use of \textit{generalized coordinates}, denoted by $q_i$, which are a set of $s$ independent parameters used to fully describe the state of the system. For instance, in the case of $n$ particles on 3-space, $s = 3n$. When constraints are imposed, the number of independent parameters is reduced by the number $m$ of constraints, so $s = 3n - m$. The \textit{generalized velocities} are the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates, $\dot{q}_1, \dot{q}_2, ..., \dot{q}_s$. Transforming between Cartesian and generalized coordinates can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
		x_{\alpha,i} &= x_{\alpha, i}(q_j, t) \\
		\dot{x}_{\alpha,i} &= \dot{x}_{\alpha, i}(q_j, \dot{q}_j, t) 
\end{split}	
\end{equation}

Where $\alpha = 1, 2, ..., n$, $i = 1, 2, 3$, and $j = 1, 2, ..., s$. The inverse transformations may be written similarly. If there are $k = 1, 2, ..., m$ constraints, they may also be written as in Eq \ref{eq:cm:lag-const-m}. Constraints of this form are called \textit{holonomic}. They interrelate  conventional coordinates and possibly time.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
		q_{j} &= q_{j}(x_{\alpha, i}, t) \\
		\dot{q}_{j} &= \dot{q}_j(x_{\alpha, i}, \dot{x}_{\alpha, i}, t) 
\end{split}	
\end{equation}

\eqn[eq:cm:lag-const-m]{f_k(x_{\alpha, i}, t) = 0}


% Undetermined Multipliers
\subsection{Undetermined Multipliers}
If all the constraints in a system are holonomic, then is always possible to find a proper set of generalized coordinates such that the equations of motion do not reference the constraints. However, if the constraints are expressible in differential form (Eq. \ref{eq:cm:diff-const}), then it is possible to incorporate them directly into the equations of motion as in Eq. \ref{eq:cm:lag-motion-const}.
\eqn[eq:cm:diff-const]{\sum\limits_{j}\pd{f_k}{q_j}dq_j = 0\where k = 1, ..., m\ \text{and} j = 1, ..., s}
\eqn[eq:cm:lag-motion-const]{\pd{\Lag}{q_j} - \ddt\pd{\Lag}{\dot{q}_j} + \sum\limits_{k}\lambda_{k}(t)\pd{f_k}{q_j} = 0}
Where the $\lambda_k(t)$ are the \textit{undetermined Lagrangian multipliers}. These multipliers are closely related to the generalized forces of constraint $Q_j$ by:
\eqn{Q_j = \sum\limits_{k}\lambda_k \pd{f_k}{q_j}}


% Example usage: pendulum
\subsection{Example: Simple Pendulum}
\label{sec:cm-lag-pend}
The below example shows how Lagrangian formalism can be used to simplify the equations of motion using generalized coordinates:

\texfig[0.35]{cm-lag-pend}{A simple pendulum of length $l$ with a mass $m$ suspended at an angle $\theta$.}

%We must first choose coordinates for the single particle of interest - the suspended mass. We can do this in the Cartesian sense of $(x, y)$, but then would have to impose the constraint $x^2 + y^2 - l^2 = 0$. Fortunately, since the constraint is independent of time, there must exist a set of generalized coordinates where the constraint is implicit. We choose polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ and so that the constraint is simply $\dot{r}\equiv 0$. 
\eqn{\Lag = T - U = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 - mgy = \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 - (-mgl\cos\theta)}
\eqn{\pd{\Lag}{\theta} = -mgl\sin\theta,\quad \pd{\Lag}{\dot{\theta}}=ml^2\dot{\theta}}
\eqn{\ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{l}\sin\theta = 0\quad\quad \omega_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{g}{l}},\ \text{for small}\ \theta}

\section{Hamiltonian Mechanics}
\label{sec:cm-hamiltonian}
\index{Hamiltonian!Mechanics}

% Introduction
The Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics is most simply introduced as the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian formulation in the variable $\dot{q}$. The definition of the Hamiltonian (Eq. \ref{eq:cm-damp-force}) is an application of the more general Legendre transformation (Eq. \ref{eq:app-calc-var-legendre}). For more on Legendre Transforms, see Appendix \ref{sec:app-calc-var-legendre}.
\eqn[eq:cm-ham-def]{\Ham(p, q) = \sum_i p_i \dot{q}_i - \Lag \approx T + U}
The equations of motion are then given by the coupled, first-order differential equations:
\eqn{\dot{p}_i = -\pd{\Ham}{q_i},\quad \dot{q}_i = \pd{\Ham}{p_i}}

% Distinction from Lagrangian
\subsection{Comparison with Lagrangian Formalism}
Since Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations are equivalent in that the produce identical dynamics, the most important distinction between them is the number and type of equations they produce. The Lagrangian approach produces $N$, second-order differential equations, whereas the Hamiltonian approach produces $2N$, first-order differential equations, as summarized in the below table:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lcl}
	 \textbf{Formulation} & \textbf{Number of Equations} & \textbf{Type of Equations} \\
	\hline
	 Lagrangian & $N$ & Second-order \\
	 Hamiltonian & $2N$ & First-order \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% "Canonical" terminology
It is worth mentioning briefly that Hamilton's equations of motion are called the \textit{canonical} equations of motion, with $p_i$ and $q_i$ being the \textit{canonical variables}. This terminology signifies a preference for Hamilton's formulation, largely based on the nice, symmmetric form of Eq. \ref{eq:cm-ham-def}. There are deeper reasons to prefer the Hamiltonian to the Lagrangian, such as the connection with symplectic forms in the phase space of the system being compatible with the Hamiltonian and canonical transformations, but these reasons are out of scope for this review.


% Conservation theorems
\subsection{Relation to Energy}
The Hamiltonian can also be derived by modifying the Lagrangian to make the time derivative vanish. The form of the Lagrangian's full time derivative is given by Eq \ref{eq:cm-cons-ham-deriv-1}, where we can set the last term equal to 0 if the system is closed. We use Euler's equation (Eq. \ref{eq:cm:lag-eqn}) to substitute for $\pd{\Lag}{q_i}$ in Eq. \ref{eq:cm-cons-ham-deriv-2}, and lastly exploit the product rule to pull the time derivative out in Eq. \ref{eq:cm-cons-ham-deriv-3}. This result shows that the Hamiltonian is, by default, time independent.  


\eqn[eq:cm-cons-ham-deriv-1]{\ddt[\Lag] = \sum\limits_i\pd{\Lag}{q_i}\dot{q}_i + \sum\limits_i\pd{\Lag}{\dot{q}_i}\ddot{q}_i + \pd{\Lag}{t}\where \pd{\Lag}{t}=0\ \text{for a closed system}}
\eqn[eq:cm-cons-ham-deriv-2]{\ddt[\Lag]=\sum\limits_i \dot{q}_i\ddt\pd{\Lag}{\dot{q}_i}+ \sum\limits_i\pd{\Lag}{\dot{q}_i}\ddot{q}_i \where \pd{\Lag}{q_i} = \ddt \pd{\Lag}{\dot{q}_i}}
\eqn[eq:cm-cons-ham-deriv-3]{\ddt[\Lag] - \sum\limits_i\ddt\left(\dot{q}\pd{\Lag}{\dot{q}_i}\right) = \ddt \left(\Lag - \sum\limits_i q_i p_i \right) = 0}
\eqn{\implies \sum\limits_i p_i q_i - \Lag = \Ham = \text{constant}}

\newpage
The Hamiltonian may be constant in time, but showing that this quantity represents the total energy of the system requires a few more steps:
\eqn[eq:cm-cons-ham-1]{\pd{\Lag}{\dot{q}_i} = \pd{\left(T - U\right)}{\dot{q}_i} = \pd{T}{\dot{q}_i}\quad \text{iff}\quad \pd{U}{\dot{q}_i}=0}
\eqn[eq:cm-cons-ham-2]{\Ham = \sum\limits_i \dot{q}_i \pd{T}{\dot{q}_i} - (T - U) = T + U = E\quad \text{iff}\quad\sum\limits_i \dot{q}_i \pd{T}{\dot{q}_i} = 2T}
The Hamiltonian thus is equivalent to the energy of the system under two conditions, represented above in the "if and only if" statements from Eqns \ref{eq:cm-cons-ham-1} and \ref{eq:cm-cons-ham-2} respectively. To state these conditions more explicitly:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The potential must be velocity independent, thus allowing for the elimination of the $\pd{U}{\dot{q}_i}$ terms.
	\item Coordinate transformation from Cartesian to generalized coordinates must be independent of time, ensuring kinetic energy is a homogeneous quadratic function of the conjugate momenta variables $\dot{q}_i$, e.g. $T = \sum_{i,j}a_{ij}\dot{q}_i\dot{q}_j$.
\end{enumerate}

% Example usage: pendulum
\subsection{Example: Simple Pendulum Revisited}
The below example shows how the Hamiltonian formalism can be used similarly to how the Lagrangian formalism was used in Sec \ref{sec:cm-lag-pend}.

\eqn{\Ham = \sum\limits_{i}p_i \dot{q}_i - \Lag = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta} - \Lag = \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 - mgl\cos\theta = T + U = E_{\text{total}}}
\eqn{\Ham(\theta, p_{\theta}) = \frac{p_{\theta}^2}{2ml^2} - mgl\cos{\theta}}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{3}
	\dot{\theta} &= &\pd{\Ham}{p_{\theta}} &= \frac{p_{\theta}}{ml^2} \\
	\dot{p}_{\theta} &= &-\pd{\Ham}{\theta} &= -mgl\sin{\theta} 
\end{alignat}	
\end{subequations}


\eqn{\ddot{\theta} = \frac{\dot{p}_{\theta}}{ml^2} \implies \ddot{\theta} + \omega_0^2\sin\theta = 0\where \omega_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{g}{l}},\ \text{for small}\ \theta}
